I regret to inform you that I do not have an online portfolio showcasing my work, as I have not engaged in any public projects or activities that could be demonstrated through a portfolio. However, I am happy to discuss my professional experience and skills in detail to better illustrate my qualifications for the position.

Additionally, I do have a GitHub account; however, it is separated into a work-related account and a personal one. Unfortunately, my personal GitHub account does not adequately demonstrate my full range of activities and projects. Nonetheless, I believe that my professional experience and the skills outlined in my resume will effectively showcase my capabilities as a software engineer.

Lastly, starting from 2023, I am planning to actively participate in social events, such as hackathons and other tech gatherings, to further develop my skills and network with like-minded individuals in the industry.
